\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, our study involving 105 students in India revealed significant insights into the influence of personality traits on plagiarism and the effectiveness of sensitizing students about plagiarism via an honor pledge in mitigating academic misconduct. Our findings underscored that extraversion and conscientiousness traits play pivotal roles in shaping plagiarism behavior, with extraversion positively associated and conscientiousness negatively associated with plagiarism. However, the impact of educational interventions on reducing plagiarism was found to be limited. This aligns with the framework of the fraud triangle, which emphasizes the role of rationalization, opportunity, and pressure in fostering fraudulent behavior. In the highly competitive academic landscape of India, where pressure to excel is pronounced, addressing underlying pressures faced by students emerges as a critical strategy for promoting academic integrity. Therefore, our study highlights the importance of adopting comprehensive approaches that not only focus on sensitizing students about plagiarism but also address the underlying pressures contributing to academic misconduct.
