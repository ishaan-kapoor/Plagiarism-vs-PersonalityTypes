abstract = {In general, university guidelines or policies on plagiarism are not sufficiently detailed to cope with the technical complexity of software. Software plagiarism can have a significant impact on a student's degree result, particularly in courses were there is a significant emphasis on large-scale projects. We argue that a policy for software reuse is the most explicit, and fair, way of overcoming this problem. In our policy, we specify the notion of software to cover all the documents that are generally built during the engineering of a software system -- analysis, requirements, validation, design, verification, implementation and tests. Examples are used to show acceptable and unacceptable forms of reuse, mostly at the design, testing and implementation stages. These examples are represented in Java, although they should be easily understood by anyone with software engineering experience. We conclude with a simple code of practice for reuse of software based on a file-level policy, combined with emphasis on re-using only what is rigorously verified.},

	abstract = {Abstract
              
                It is not uncommon for researchers to want to interrogate paired binomial data. For example, researchers may want to compare an organism’s response (positive or negative) to two different stimuli. If they apply both stimuli to a sample of individuals, it would be natural to present the data in a 2 × 2 table. There would be two cells with concordant results (the frequency of individuals which responded positively or negatively to both stimuli) and two cells with discordant results (the frequency of individuals who responded positively to one stimulus, but negatively to the other). The key issue is whether the totals in the two discordant cells are sufficiently different to suggest that the stimuli trigger different reactions. In terms of the null hypothesis testing paradigm, this would translate as a
                P
                value which is the probability of seeing the observed difference in these two values or a more extreme difference if the two stimuli produced an identical reaction. The statistical test designed to provide this
                P
                value is the McNemar test. Here, we seek to promote greater and better use of the McNemar test. To achieve this, we fully describe a range of circumstances within biological research where it can be effectively applied, describe the different variants of the test that exist, explain how these variants can be accessed in R, and offer guidance on which of these variants to adopt. To support our arguments, we highlight key recent methodological advances and compare these with a novel survey of current usage of the test.
              
            
            
              Significance statement
              When analysing paired binomial data, researchers appear to reflexively apply a chi-squared test, with the McNemar test being largely overlooked, despite it often being more appropriate. As these tests evaluate a different null hypothesis, selecting the appropriate test is essential for effective analysis. When using the McNemar test, there are four methods that can be applied. Recent advice has outlined clear guidelines on which method should be used. By conducting a survey, we provide support for these guidelines, but identify that the method chosen in publications is rarely specified or the most appropriate. Our study provides clear guidance on which method researchers should select and highlights examples of when this test should be used and how it can be implemented easily to improve future research.},

Prior work has found that cultural and ethical norms become ingrained early in STEM professionals’ careers; so, we focus on students approaching graduation and after an internship experience, who are just getting started in their career. In semi-structured interviews, a majority of these final-year computing students (14 of 16) indicated that they were not motivated to improve their skills in accessibility, attributing this to not being required to consider accessibility in subsequent work or classes, not seeing accessibility as an essential skill in their profession, and challenges due to a learn-it-on-your-own approach in computing. Participants suggested instructional methods and topics that they believed would have better prepared them for considering accessibility. A survey of 114 additional final-year students revealed similar themes, including that students did not personally view accessibility training as essential career preparation. Prior research has largely focused on evaluating short-term changes in students’ knowledge after an educational intervention. Therefore, by focusing on students several years after an intervention, this work highlights lingering barriers for university programs in promoting accessibility among rising computing professionals.},

	abstract = {About 15\% of the world's population lives with some form of disability, of whom 2-4\% experience significant difficulties in functioning. The global disability prevalence is higher than previous WHO estimates, which date from the 1970s and suggested a figure of around 10\%. This global estimate for disability is on the rise due to population ageing and the rapid spread of chronic diseases, as well as improvements in the methodologies used to measure disability.

The first ever WHO/World Bank World report on disability reviews evidence about the situation of people with disabilities around the world. Following chapters on understanding disability and measuring disability, the report contains topic-specific chapters on health; rehabilitation; assistance and support; enabling environments; education; and employment. Within each chapter, there is a discussion of the barriers confronted, and case studies showing how countries have succeeded in addressing these by promoting good practice. In its final chapter, the report offers nine concrete recommendations for policy and practice which if put in place could lead to real improvements in the lives of people with disability.

The summary of the report contains the main messages and recommendations. The summary report is available in easy-to-read, audio, and screen reader compatible formats. Braille versions (English, Spanish and French) can be ordered by contacting disability@who.int.},

The previous site had been built upon in layers since its launch in 2004, resulting in a large and complex site. This complexity made it difficult to incorporate sweeping changes without causing regressions. The new site enabled us to prevent accessibility issues from the beginning, and a new codebase made it possible for us to integrate new accessibility tools and features that would have been difficult or impossible to build and maintain on the old site.

By taking advantage of the latest advancements in React, we have been able to introduce new accessibility tools, techniques, and technology. The result is a carefully crafted experience for people who benefit from increased legibility, Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) markup, and keyboard navigation. In our last round of research with screen reader users, all participants wanted to remain opted into the site, citing its improved accessibility. Today, we are sharing some of the techniques we introduced that advance accessibility support on Facebook.com.},

	abstract = {Ensuring that software systems are accessible to users with disabilities is historically neglected but increasingly important for professional software developers. It is imperative that students are familiar with accessible practices to support this often-overlooked form of diversity. We suggest that including accessibility topics when teaching user-interface development skills is a low-effort task that can directly support teaching core software development principles such as "separation of concerns" and "standards compliance." In this lightning talk we describe our initial efforts to integrate accessibility and accessible design as "first-class" topics into our department's required course on web development, including specific examples of concepts covered, classroom activities, and assignments. We also discuss suggestions for how to potentially integrate accessibility topics into other computer science courses which include any kinds of front-end user interfaces. The goal of this talk is to promote awareness of accessibility concerns, demonstrate the ease by which educators can include such material, and encourage discussion about how to engage students in such diversity considerations throughout the curriculum.},

The paper reports on the three iterations of the course evolution as topics and pedagogy are updated from one iteration to the next. The main motivation of the course updates was to cover the educational needs of software engineering students, which are not the same as HCI or design students. Software engineering students learned better and became more engaged with the topic of accessibility when it was tied to programming and developmentbased activities. The final form of the course was evaluated using a survey, and the results showed that students found the course beneficial to their education and relevant to their career.We discuss the challenges of creating, teaching, and maintaining a course on accessibility, and we offer insights on what research is needed in this area to support accessibility educators.},

	abstract = {Most CS students learn little about accessibility in higher education; this is partly because most CS faculty know little about accessibility. Unfortunately, higher education CS faculty lack a model of professional development for learning to teach new topics. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility of a “micro” professional development model for teaching accessibility in CS courses that could be used at scale. We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with U.S. CS faculty, asking them to explore a prototype of a web-based professional development tool that linked accessibility topics to CS topics. We found that many organizational factors limited faculty's autonomy to integrate accessibility in many of their courses. We also found that individual values and knowledge constrained faculty's ability and willingness to both learn and integrate accessibility topics into their courses. However, many faculty expressed desire to teach accessibility in their courses if they had access to even basic accessibility content and materials to use in their courses.},

First, we need further investigation into precisely how to structure and present content so it is easy to integrate and appropriate. A more detailed case study of faculty use of content could elicit these requirements. Second, with enough content ready for adoption, a pilot deployment to CS faculty would also reveal to what extent the findings in this study would also occur in the even more complex reality of daily faculty life."

Guest lectures, meant to give the students different perspectives on disability, are integral part of the course. Guest lecturers include experts in disability studies, professionals working with people with disabilities, and persons with disability. To gain practical knowledge, the students carry out group projects or volunteering activities that involves people with disabilities. Since its first introduction in 2006, the course had always filled to capacity. A survey with 75 students conducted in Winter 2010 revealed that students felt that their knowledge about universal access and disabilities had improved significantly, and that they had become aware of accessibility in everyday life.},

Disability simulations are one resource, but often criticized for failing to guide digital designers appropriately, and it is unclear if digital designers are aware of the issues surrounding disability simulations. I surveyed 92 digital designers to understand their perspectives toward disability simulations (both perceived advantages and disadvantages). I then shared work process challenges faced by digital designers and their reasons for using disability simulations with 17 people with vision impairments to facilitate a discussion on this topic. The interviewees discussed ideas that suggest many paths can be explored to connect digital designers and disabled people, in general, to reduce reliance on simulations, and a change is needed within workplace processes, culture, and stafng to further support positive change. There are research opportunities to investigate establishing avenues for connecting digital designers and disabled people in a way that is benefcial to both groups.},

By analyzing popular empathy activities aimed at understanding people with disabilities, we examine the ways empathy works to both powerfully and problematically align designers with the values of people who may use their products. Drawing on disability studies and feminist theorizing, we describe how acts of empathy building may further distance people with disabilities from the processes designers intend to draw them into. We end by reimagining empathy as guided by the lived experiences of people with disabilities who are traditionally positioned as those to be empathized.},

abstract = {There appears to be a reasonably common understanding about plagiarism and collusion in essays and other assessment items written in prose text. However, most assessment items in computing are not based in prose. There are computer programs, databases, spreadsheets, and web designs, to name but a few. It is far from clear that the same sort of consensus about plagiarism and collusion applies when dealing with such assessment items; and indeed it is not clear that computing academics have the same core beliefs about originality of authorship as apply in the world of prose. We have conducted focus groups at three Australian universities to investigate what academics and students in computing think constitute breaches of academic integrity in non-text-based assessment items; how they regard such breaches; and how academics discourage such breaches, detect them, and deal with those that are found. We find a general belief that non-text-based computing assessments differ in this regard from text-based assessments, that the boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable practice are harder to define than they are for text assessments, and that there is a case for applying different standards to these two different types of assessment. We conclude by discussing what we can learn from these findings.},

Students at both institutions showed similar responses to a range of cheating behaviours, in line with other literature. Plagiarism and cheating are widely tolerated and commonly practised, at least on the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness. However there were some areas of significant difference between the two student samples that warrant further research to develop strategic approaches for limiting cheating practices.},

abstract = {In recent years academic integrity has come to be seen as a major concern across the full educational spectrum. The case has been made that in certain ways academic integrity is not the same in computing education as in education more generally, and that as a consequence it is the responsibility of computing educators to explicitly advise their students of the academic integrity requirements of their assessments. As part of a larger project, computing academics around the world were asked a number of questions regarding how they advise their students about academic integrity in programming assessments. Almost all respondents indicated that their students were required to abide by an academic integrity policy, but only about half of them felt that the policy was appropriate for programming assessments. We analyse respondents' descriptions of how they advise students about academic integrity in programming assessments, grouping them into a number of themes, and give excerpts from the guidelines that some respondents provide for their students. A clear finding from the survey is that while most educators agree that externally sourced code or assistance should be acknowledged, fewer than 20\% are aware of any standard form for that acknowledgement. We therefore conclude by proposing, for discussion, a standard form for acknowledging externally sourced code or assistance.},

abstract = {Academic integrity in computing education is a source of much confusion and disagreement. Studies of student and academic approaches to academic integrity in computing indicate considerable variation in practice along with confusion as to what practices are acceptable. The difficulty appears to arise in part from perceived differences between academic practice in computing education and professional practice in the computing industry, which lead to challenges in devising a consistent and meaningful approach to academic integrity. Coding practices in industry rely heavily on teamwork and use of external resources, but when computing educators seek to model industry practice in the classroom these techniques tend to conflict with standard academic integrity policies, which focus on assessing individual achievement.We have surveyed both industry professionals and computing academics about practices relating to academic integrity, and can confirm the uncertainty and variability that permeates the field. We find clear divergence in the views of these two groups, and also a broad range of practices considered acceptable by the academics.Our findings establish a clear need to clarify academic integrity issues in the context of computing education. Educators must carefully consider how academic integrity issues relate to their learning objectives, teaching approaches, and the industry practice for which they are preparing students. To this end we propose a process that fulfils two purposes: to guide academics in the consideration of academic integrity issues when designing assessment items, and to effectively communicate the resulting guidelines to students so as to reduce confusion and improve educational practice.},

abstract = {In general, university guidelines or policies on plagiarism are not sufficiently detailed to cope with the technical complexity of software. Software plagiarism can have a significant impact on a student's degree result, particularly in courses were there is a significant emphasis on large-scale projects. We argue that a policy for software reuse is the most explicit, and fair, way of overcoming this problem. In our policy, we specify the notion of software to cover all the documents that are generally built during the engineering of a software system -- analysis, requirements, validation, design, verification, implementation and tests. Examples are used to show acceptable and unacceptable forms of reuse, mostly at the design, testing and implementation stages. These examples are represented in Java, although they should be easily understood by anyone with software engineering experience. We conclude with a simple code of practice for reuse of software based on a file-level policy, combined with emphasis on re-using only what is rigorously verified.},

The students who took the take-home exam enabled a software plugin that recorded their programming process. During an analysis of the students' submissions, potential plagiarism cases were highlighted, and students were invited to interviews.The interviews with the candidates for plagiarism highlighted three types of plagiarism behaviors: help-seeking, collaboration, and systematic cheating. Analysis of programming process traces indicates that parts of such behavior are detectable directly from programming process data.},

abstract = {Learning to program is a complex task and is the reason that many novice programmers plagiarise source code when learning to program. There are many automated plagiarism detection tools which have been used to detect the plagiarism of source code, typically leading to disciplinary action being taken against students. This study investigates whether there is a difference in the plagiarism behaviour of students committing plagiarism for "acceptable" reasons as compared to "unacceptable" reasons so that an automated support tool for novice programmers might be viable. It was found that the reasons for committing plagiarism are most likely due to a lack of knowledge and that students commit plagiarism as a last resort in many cases. It was also found that there were differences between the behaviour of students plagiarising for "acceptable" and "unacceptable" reasons. Below average students plagiarising multiple lines of source code up to a complete method most likely do so for "acceptable" reasons. It was not possible to distinguish between "acceptable" and "unacceptable" plagiarising behaviour for above average subjects, but the plagiarising of multiple classes or files was almost always for "unacceptable" reasons.},
